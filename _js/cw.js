Most folks who come to the barn don&rsquo;t realize that he is a stallion because he is so gentle. Poe has a strong, compact, baroque body style, adding to his appeal and athleticism. Poe has a natural gait and good hard feet which allows him to remain barefoot year &rsquo;round. He gives his offspring his easy-going nature and trainability. His babies have also all been very personable and like to be with people."
